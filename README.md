# Overview

This document describes the components of a portfolio created with React.js. This portfolio, as it stands, will not be used for job searches. 

It contains the following components:
- A `<Header>`, which contains a `<Nav>` bar;
- An `<About>` section, which contains important details about the featured coder;
- A `<Project>` section, which contains the coder's portfolio and projects;
- A `<Contact>` section, which contains a form without event handling;
- A `<Footer>` section, which contains links to the coder's social media
